Hello Everyone!
This is my first post on a new blog. I used to write blogs but I found it out of fashion. Hey when you have twitter and its 140 characters why do you need any blogs, right?

I was wrong. I realized that the best learning resources I have are these blogs out there. I want to thank you all bloggers for inspiring me and for providing me with awesome content to learn from.

I wanted to use this first post to list all the blogs I have been reading and learning from.
Following is the list of all the blogs and websites I have been learning from:
