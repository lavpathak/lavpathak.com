title: Build vs Buy
---

As a consultant I have faced this particular question quite often at different clients. I don't think there is a singular answer to this question so as a consultant we tend to give answer that usually starts with "Well it depends..".

Following is the thought process that I usually follow. I have seen some of my coworkers do the same.

### Question:
When does an organization invest in building custom software vs buying an off the shelf application?

### Rule of Thumb:
1. If it’s core to your business, build it.
2. If there’s COTS and you are willing to change YOUR PROCESS to match the tool, buy it.
3. If there’s COTS and you have to do significant customization that doesn’t match their model, build it.
4. If there’s COTS and you have to do insignificant customization within their model, buy it.
5. If while you’re trying #4 you realize that your customization is more significant and less of a match, see #3 and don’t fall into the sunk cost fallacy.
6. If other services that are core to your business have to integrate with it, and evolving this integration is going to impact your ability to serve business needs, build it.
