title: Adding disques comments to blog posts
---

Sorry for the long delay on this. Last couple of months have been very busy on personal front. Finally got chance to add comments section to my blog posts.

Going with <a href='https://disqus.com' target="_blank">disqus</a> was an easy decision. Their sign up and installation process for very easy. Jekyll is one of their default content publishing platform. 

Just couple of things to keep in mind if you go with disqus. 
* You'll need to have ```url``` variable defined in your ```_config.yml```. 
* Disqus requires page.url variable set, that variable has to be the full url of the page. So there you will need ```site.url``` that you set in config file.

Hope this helps. Love yo hear your feedback on my posts moving forward.
Thanks
