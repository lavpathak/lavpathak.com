  I am skilled software architect having startup mentality with enterprise awareness. I have 10+ years of experience in developing software applications within various industry verticals and complexities. I strategically focus on delivering applications through the use of lightweight, robust processes and methodologies such as Evolutionary Architecture, DevOps, Continuous Delivery, TDD and Agile. I am constantly learning because that’s how I add value to an organization.  I want to put my skills and attributes to work in an organization that shares similar attitudes. As much as I love designing and architecting solutions, I also love to stay close to implementation details. I also have a good eye for project management. Having the big picture in my mind helps me plan tasks efficiently in the grand scheme of things.
